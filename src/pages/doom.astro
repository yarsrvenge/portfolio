          This is an older project from back in 2015. While a couple of people
          had gotten Doom running on tvOS, they either had not released source
          code, or did not have it running on more recent SDK's and buildable in
          Xcode 8. I hadn't seen anyone implement game controller support
          either.

        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          I managed to get it running with game controller support under Xcode
          8. I used a fork of John Carmack's original code as a starting point.
          The code has not been updated in a while and did not support 64 bit
          architecture let alone the latest iOS / tvOS framework versions. I
          created the targets for tvOS and made several changes to allow it to
          run.

        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          The fork I used as a starting point expects the user to grab image
          assets and the WAD files from the paid version of iOS Doom. I didn't
          see a reason to use the image assets iD used from the paid version, so
          I used assets that were not included by iD in the menus and so forth.
          That way, as long as someone has the WAD file from the paid version
          (I've bought it MANY, MANY times over the years) and a Mac they can
          sideload the project from Github in Xcode, add the WAD file and get it
          up and running pretty easily. It also allowed me to use assets that
          are higher resolution for the menus. Currently, this is all gitignored
          so as not to violate licensing.

        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          The code uses AudioToolbox which was deprecated a while ago and that
          piece needs to be rewritten to use AVAudioPlayer. There are also some
          button overlays used for iOS that not needed on tvOS.
