          If you're into collecting old games or emulating classics from your
          childhood, you know how much information is out there‚Äîand how
          scattered it can be. I'm working on a project that brings all of that
          together using a multi-agent AI system specifically tailored for retro
          game enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          I've been studying multi-agent AI systems over the past several months
          as I can see a lot of utility even if the larger AI bubble "bursts".
          This bot is a way of getting some experience with building something from
          the ground up that will allow me to leverage this architecture for future
          work projects.

        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          The assistant helps users with common tasks like:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-zinc-400 leading-8 text-lg">
          <li>Looking up the history and background of a game</li>
          <li>
            Estimating market value for cartridges, discs, and complete-in-box
            (CIB) sets
          </li>
          <li>Finding out how to emulate games on modern systems</li>
          <li>Offering restoration tips for old consoles and cartridges</li>
          <li>Recommending similar games based on your favorites</li>
          <li>Fetching known high scores and speedrun records</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          Whether you're a seasoned collector, a casual gamer, or someone just
          getting into ROM hacks and EverDrives, this tool is built to assist.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">üß† Why Multi-Agent AI?</h2>
        <hr class="mb-4 border-zinc-600" />
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          Multi-agent systems are exactly what they sound like: multiple
          specialized AI agents, each with a focused area of expertise. Instead
          of using one big general-purpose model like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini
          this approach lets me create purpose-built agents like:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-zinc-400 leading-8 text-lg">
          <li>
            A <code class="bg-zinc-800 px-1 rounded">GameHistorianAgent</code> for
            deep background
          </li>
          <li>
            A <code class="bg-zinc-800 px-1 rounded">MarketPriceAgent</code> for
            price estimates
          </li>
          <li>
            An <code class="bg-zinc-800 px-1 rounded">EmulationAgent</code> to guide
            you through setting up games
          </li>
          <li>
            A <code class="bg-zinc-800 px-1 rounded">RestorationAgent</code> for
            hardware help
          </li>
          <li>
            And even a <code class="bg-zinc-800 px-1 rounded"
              >RecommendationAgent</code
            > to suggest what to play next
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          These agents are orchestrated by a central AI that interprets user
          queries, figures out which agents are needed, and combines their
          responses into a final answer. This pattern allows for better
          scalability, clearer architecture, and more control over the knowledge
          domains.

          The assistant isn't just a search engine. It can:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-zinc-400 leading-8 text-lg">
          <li>
            Ask follow-up questions when a query is unclear (e.g., "Which
            version of Aladdin‚ÄîSNES or Genesis?")
          </li>
          <li>Handle small talk or off-topic questions gracefully</li>

            Architecture is modular, so agents can be updated or swapped as

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">üìö Why It Matters</h2>
        <hr class="mb-4 border-zinc-600" />
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          This project isn't just about retro games‚Äîit's about learning how to
          build AI systems that collaborate, specialize, and reason together.
          Multi-agent systems mirror how real teams work: you don't ask one
          person to do everything‚Äîyou bring in the right experts for the job.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mb-3 text-zinc-400">
          That's the magic of agentic AI: it's modular, extensible, and far more
          capable than a single generalist model acting alone.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg text-pretty mt-8 text-zinc-400 italic">
          If you're a fellow retro nerd, AI builder, or just curious about what
          this looks like in action‚Äîstay tuned! More updates soon! I hope to
          have an initial build by May 2025.
